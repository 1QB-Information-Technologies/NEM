# Tutorials

Here are examples for how to perform neural error mitigation on the systems studied in the paper: H2, LiH and the lattice Schwinger model. 


## Notes
See Table S1 in the Supplementary Information for the hyperparameter values used in neural error mitigation and VQE for each system. In order to reproduce the results of our paper, one would perform neural error mitigation (with hyperparameters in Table S1) from the VQE data saved in `data` for each parameter value and run.
