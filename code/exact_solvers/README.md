# Exact Solvers

In the exact solvers directory, we have an exact diagonalizer (`ExactDiagonalizer`) and an object class for generic wavefunctions (`GenericExactState`). Here, the `ExactDiagonalizer` takes the Hamiltonian generated by a `PhysicsModel` and solves for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the system. The `GenericExactState` saves the wavefunction and has various operations using the state such as computing the fidelity between the state and another, extracting the amplitudes, sampling from the state, etc.
