# Neural Quantum States (NQS)

This directory, `nqs_models`, constructs the neural quantum states that will be trained using neural quantum state tomography and variational Monte Carlo during neural error mitigation.

`NeuralQuantumState`: Parent class for repurposing a neural network into a neural quantum state. Our NQS utilizes PyTorch's machine learning functionalities

`TransformerWF`: Constructs a Transformer NQS based off of a Transformer neural network.
