# Neural Error Mitigation of Near-term Quantum Simulation

Here we demonstrate the numerical implementation of neural error mitigation, a novel method that uses neural networks to
improve estimates of ground states and ground-state observables obtained using VQE on near-term quantum computers.
This method, introduced in "Neural Error Mitigation of Near-term Quantum Simulations" https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08086, is composed of two main steps:

**(A)** First, we perform neural quantum state tomography (NQST) to
        train a neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz to represent the
        approximate ground state prepared by a noisy quantum device,
        using experimentally accessible measurements.
        - NeuralErrorMitigationTrainer uses NQSTomographyTrainer for this step

**(B)**
 We then apply the variational Monte Carlo algorithm (VMC)
        on the same neural quantum state ansatz (which we call the
        NEM ansatz) to improve the representation of the unknown
        ground state.
        - NeuralErrorMitigationTrainer uses VMCTrainer_Regularized
         for this step

## Tutorials
Tutorials to demonstrate the application of neural error mitigation to the variational simulation of physical systems studied in "Neural Error Mitigation of Near-term Quantum Simulations." More specifically, improving estimates of the ground state and ground state observables for the electronic structure of LiH and H2 molecules as well as the lattice Schwinger model. Additionally, demo files are included to show how the variational simulations are implemented.

In order to reproduce the results of our paper, one would perform neural error mitigation (with hyperparameter values listed in Table S1) from the VQE data saved in `data` for each parameter value and run.

Here, we input measurements taken on the final optimized VQE result (from saved data in `data/LiHmolecule/DepolarizingNoise/` folder) and use those measurements in our neural error mitigation protocol. (Standard runtime ~ 4 minutes)
